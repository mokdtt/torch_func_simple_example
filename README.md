# torch_func_simple_example

This repository contains two notebooks demonstrating the usage of `torch.func`.

## Notebook 1: Understanding Gradient and Hessian Calculation

This notebook focuses on computing gradients and Hessians using `torch.func` with a simple logistic regression model. It verifies the computed values against analytically calculated ones.

## Notebook 2: Exploring Matrix Relationships and Properties

This notebook explores computing gradients, Hessians, Fisher Information Matrix, and Generalized Gauss-Newton Matrix using `torch.func`. It employs a small fully connected network model and investigate the relationships and properties of these matrices.
